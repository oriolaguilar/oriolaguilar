### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ (To be completed)

My name is Oriol, I'm an undergraduate student of the Double Degree of Computer Science and Business Administration at the University of Lleida (Spain).

Here you can find some projects I've made on my free-time and for college:

## A* PathFinder Visualizer + TSP:

I wanted to do something visual but, that at the same time, implementing algorithms so I decided to do a A* PathFinder Visualizer. Later on I decided to improve this project by adding more features:

The project was done interely in Python, using pygame library for the interface.

* Be able to draw the walls and erase them and select the initial and end point and the algorithm will find the shortest path.
* Possibility of adding some checkpoints instead of an end point and the algorithm will find out the shortest path between all of them.
* Zoom. Possibility of making the grid smaller or bigger and be able to zoom-in and be able to draw or erase with more detail.

## TCP & UDP Server-Client:

## Unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe:
