### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ (To be completed)

My name is Oriol, I'm an undergraduate student of the Double Degree of Computer Science and Business Administration at the University of Lleida (Spain).

Here you can find some projects I've made on my free-time and for college assignments:

## A* PathFinder Visualizer + Travelling Salesman Problem:

I wanted to do something visual but, at the same time, I wanted to implement algorithms so I decided to do a A* PathFinder Visualizer. Later on I decided to improve this project by adding more features:

* (Original idea) Be able to draw the walls and erase them and select the initial and end point and the algorithm will find the shortest path.
* Possibility of adding checkpoints instead of an end point and the algorithm will find out the shortest path between all of them (Travelling Salesman Problem).
* Zoom. Possibility of making the grid smaller or bigger and be able to zoom-in and be able to draw or erase with more detail.

The project was done interely in Python, using pygame library for the interface.

## TCP & UDP Server-Client:

It was a university project for the course of "Networks" it consisted on creating a server file made with C and a client made with Python. We had to follow a connection protocol that included a register phase, a connection-maintenance phase and, finally, a data exchange phase. All the phases were complete enough so the program recognised wrong packages and knew how to deal with them.

The topics we have to deal with when working with the project were: Multithreading, communication with pipes, UDP and TCP connections, packing and unpacking of data in different types of PDU's (Protocol Data Units), pointers...


All the debugging messages, the report and the project's statement are in catalan but the code, function names and variable names, are in English. 

## Twitter Clone (kinda)
...

I have made other "minor" projects such as: an [Unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe](), projects where I worked with [design patterns](https://github.com/oriolaguilar/2-practica-patrons-disseny), [JUnit testing](https://github.com/oriolaguilar/E-Receipt),...
